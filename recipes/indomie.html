            <li>Spoon</li>
            <li>Plate</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>For the ingredients are all actually inside the package already! So there's no need to worry okay :)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dried noodle</li>
            <li>Oil</li>

            <li>Powder seasoning</li>
            <li>Fried onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>Making steps are pretty straightforward, here they are!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the water</li>
            <li>Put the dried noodle in the boiled water (watch out for hot water!)</li>
            <li>While waiting until the noodle is cooked, put the oil and all the sauce on your plate and mix it up real good</li>
            <li>After the noodle is finished, discard the water and put the noodle on the plate. Once again mix it up real good with the oil and sauce (yum!)</li>
