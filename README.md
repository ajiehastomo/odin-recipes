# odin-recipes

Hello! Welcome to this little project of mine!
This project is part of Odin curriculum that teaches you about building a website!

In this project we're going to create a simple website for my favorite recipes!
We're going to use html boilerplate and tags in here such as:
    - Header
    - Paragraph
    - Strong and Emphasize
    - List
    - Anchor
    - Links

So what are we waiting for let's build it up!
